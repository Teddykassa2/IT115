                            <li>Alabama is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered by Tennessee to the north; 
                                Georgia to the east; Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south; and Mississippi to the west. Alabama 
                                is the 30th largest by area and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. With a total of 1,500 miles 
                                (2,400 km) of inland waterways, Alabama has among the most of any state.</li>

                            <li>Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest 
                            states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. It represents the seventh largest subnational division 
                            in the world. It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's 
                            most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020—more 
                            than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.</li>

                            <li>Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood 
                            on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of 
                            independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory 
                            to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.</li></ul>
